# Auto clicker project

This is my auto clicker project also known as 'EasyClicker' as I had a thing for naming all the projects I made around this time "Easy<name>". I created it to build up more experience in Python but also because I never found an auto clicker where I could queue different coordinates to click and the clicker would loop over them so I built that into this project as well.
This project was started on 28/10/2022 and finished on 14/08/2023 as I continuously added to it.
